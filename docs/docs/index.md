# MapLibre Compose

## Introduction

MapLibre Compose is a [Compose Multiplatform][compose] wrapper around the
[MapLibre][maplibre] SDKs for rendering interactive maps. You can use it to add
maps to your Compose UIs on Android and iOS.

## Usage

- [Getting Started](./getting-started.md)
- [API Reference](./api/index.html)

## Status

A large subset of MapLibre's features are already supported, but the full
breadth of the MapLibre SDKs is not yet covered. What is already supported may
have bugs. API stability is not yet guaranteed; we're still exploring how best
to express an interactive map API in Compose.

Android and iOS support is implemented with [MapLibre Native][maplibre-native].

Desktop and Web are not yet supported.
