# Interacting with the map

## Gestures

The map supports pan, zoom, rotate, and tilt gestures. Each of these can be
enabled or disabled individually:

```kotlin
-8<- "demo-app/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/sargunv/maplibrecompose/demoapp/docs/Interaction.kt:gesture-settings"
```

1. Includes pinch, double-tap, and double-tap-and-drag.

## Ornaments

Ornaments are UI elements that are displayed on the map, such as a compass or
attribution button. They're implemented by the underlying MapLibre SDK, so may
render differently on different platforms. You can control the visibility and
position of these ornaments:

```kotlin
-8<- "demo-app/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/sargunv/maplibrecompose/demoapp/docs/Interaction.kt:ornament-settings"
```

1. Insets the ornaments; useful if you have an edge-to-edge map or some UI
   elements that cover part of the map.
2. Displays a MapLibre logo
3. Possible alignments are constrained by the underlying SDK. The four corners
   are supported across platforms.
4. Displays attribution defined in the map style.
5. Displays a compass control when the map is rotated away from north.

## Camera

If you want to read or mutate the camera state, use `rememberCameraState()`. You
can use this to set the start position of the map:

```kotlin
-8<- "demo-app/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/sargunv/maplibrecompose/demoapp/docs/Interaction.kt:camera"
```

You can now use the `camera` reference to move the camera. For example,
`CameraState` exposes a `suspend fun animateTo` to animate the camera to a new
position:

```kotlin
-8<- "demo-app/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/sargunv/maplibrecompose/demoapp/docs/Interaction.kt:camera-animate"
```

## Click listeners

You can listen for clicks on the map. Given a click location, you can use camera
state to query which features are present at that location:

```kotlin
-8<- "demo-app/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/sargunv/maplibrecompose/demoapp/docs/Interaction.kt:click-listeners"
```

1. Consumes the click event, preventing it from propagating to the individual
   layers' click listeners.
