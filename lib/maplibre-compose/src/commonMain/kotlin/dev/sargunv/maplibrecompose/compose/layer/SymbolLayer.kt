/**
 * A symbol layer draws data from the [sourceLayer] in the given [source] as icons and/or text
 * labels.
 *
 * @param id Unique layer name.
 * @param source Vector data source for this layer.
 * @param sourceLayer Layer to use from the given vector tile [source].
 * @param minZoom The minimum zoom level for the layer. At zoom levels less than this, the layer
 *   will be hidden. A value in the range of `[0..24]`.
 * @param maxZoom The maximum zoom level for the layer. At zoom levels equal to or greater than
 *   this, the layer will be hidden. A value in the range of `[0..24]`.
 * @param filter An expression specifying conditions on source features. Only features that match
 *   the filter are displayed. Zoom expressions in filters are only evaluated at integer zoom
 *   levels. The `feature-state` expression is not supported in filter expressions.
 * @param visible Whether the layer should be displayed.
 * @param sortKey Sorts features within this layer in ascending order based on this value. Features
 *   with a higher sort key will appear above features with a lower sort key.
 * @param placement Symbol placement relative to its geometry. See [SymbolPlacement].
 * @param spacing Distance between two symbol anchors in dp.
 *
 *   Only applicable when [placement] is [SymbolPlacement.Line].
 *
 * @param avoidEdges If true, the symbols will not cross tile edges to avoid mutual collisions.
 *   Recommended in layers that don't have enough padding in the vector tile to prevent collisions,
 *   or if it is a point symbol layer placed after a line symbol layer.
 * @param zOrder Determines whether overlapping symbols in the same layer are rendered in the order
 *   that they appear in the data source or by their y-position relative to the viewport. To control
 *   the order and prioritization of symbols otherwise, use [sortKey]. See [SymbolSortOrder].
 * @param iconImage Image to use for drawing an image background.
 * @param iconOpacity The opacity at which the icon will be drawn. A value in the range `[0..1]`.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconColor The color of the icon. This can only be used with SDF icons.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.

 * @param iconHaloColor The color of the icon's halo. Icon halos can only be used with SDF icons.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconHaloWidth Distance of halo to the icon outline. The unit is in dp only for SDF sprites
 *   that were created with a blur radius of 8, multiplied by the display density. I.e., the radius
 *   needs to be 16 for @2x sprites, etc.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconHaloBlur Fade out the halo towards the outside, in dp.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconSize Scales the original size of the icon by the provided factor. The new pixel size
 *   of the image will be the original pixel size multiplied by [iconSize]. 1 is the original size;
 *   3 triples the size of the image.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconRotationAlignment In combination with [placement], determines the rotation behavior of
 *   icons. See [IconRotationAlignment].

 *   [iconImage] and [textField] are specified.
 *
 * @param iconKeepUpright If true, the icon may be flipped to prevent it from being rendered
 *   upside-down.
 *
 *   Only applicable if [iconRotationAlignment] is [IconRotationAlignment.Map] and [placement] is

 *
 * @param iconOffset Offset distance of icon from its anchor. Positive values indicate right and
 *   down, while negative values indicate left and up. Each component is multiplied by the value of
 *   [iconSize] to obtain the final offset in dp. When combined with [iconRotate] the offset will be
 *   as if the rotated direction was up.

 *
 * @param iconIgnorePlacement If true, other symbols can be visible even if they collide with the
 *   icon.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconOptional If true, text will display without their corresponding icons when the icon
 *   collides with other symbols and the text does not.
 *
 *   Ignored if not both [iconImage] and [textField] are specified.
 *
 * @param iconTranslate The geometry's offset relative to the [iconTranslateAnchor]. Negative
 *   numbers indicate left and up, respectively.
 *
 *   Ignored if [iconImage] is not specified.
 *
 * @param iconTranslateAnchor Frame of reference for offsetting geometry, see [TranslateAnchor].
 *

 *   as a formatted with default/inherited formatting options.
 * @param textOpacity The opacity at which the text will be drawn.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textColor The color with which the text will be drawn.

 *
 * @param textTransform Specifies how to capitalize text. See [TextTransform].
 * @param textLetterSpacing Text tracking amount in ems.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textRotationAlignment In combination with [placement], determines the rotation behavior of
 *   the individual glyphs forming the text. See [TextRotationAlignment].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textPitchAlignment Orientation of text when map is pitched. See [TextPitchAlignment].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textMaxAngle Maximum angle change in degrees between adjacent characters.
 *
 *   Only applicable if [placement] is [SymbolPlacement.Line] or [SymbolPlacement.LineCenter]
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textMaxWidth The maximum line width in ems for text wrapping.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textLineHeight Text leading value in ems for multi-line text.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textJustify Text justification options. See [TextJustify].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textWritingMode The property allows control over a symbol's orientation. Note that the
 *   property values act as a hint, so that a symbol whose language doesn’t support the provided
 *   orientation will be laid out in its natural orientation. Example: English point symbol will be
 *   rendered horizontally even if array value contains single 'vertical' enum value. The order of
 *   elements in an array define priority order for the placement of an orientation variant. See
 *   [TextWritingMode]
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textKeepUpright If true, the text may be flipped vertically to prevent it from being
 *   rendered upside-down.
 *
 *   Only applicable if [textRotationAlignment] is [TextRotationAlignment.Map] and [placement] is
 *   [SymbolPlacement.Line] or [SymbolPlacement.LineCenter]
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textRotate Rotates the text clockwise. Unit in degrees.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textAnchor Part of the text placed closest to the anchor. See [SymbolAnchor].
 *
 *   Overridden by [textVariableAnchorOffset].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textOffset Offset distance of text from its anchor in ems. Positive values indicate right
 *   and down, while negative values indicate left and up. If used with [textVariableAnchor], input
 *   values will be taken as absolute values. Offsets along the x- and y-axis will be applied
 *   automatically based on the anchor position.
 *
 *   Overridden by [textRadialOffset].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textVariableAnchor To increase the chance of placing high-priority labels on the map, you
 *   can provide an array of [textAnchor] locations: the renderer will attempt to place the label at
 *   each location, in order, before moving onto the next label. Use [textJustify] =
 *   [TextJustify.Auto] to choose justification based on anchor position. To apply an offset, use
 *   the [textRadialOffset] or the two-dimensional [textOffset].
 *
 *   Only applicable if [placement] is [SymbolPlacement.Point].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textRadialOffset Radial offset of text, in the direction of the symbol's anchor. Useful in
 *   combination with [textVariableAnchor], which defaults to using the two-dimensional [textOffset]
 *   if present.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textVariableAnchorOffset To increase the chance of placing high-priority labels on the
 *   map, you can provide an array of [SymbolAnchor] locations, each paired with an offset value.
 *   The renderer will attempt to place the label at each location, in order, before moving on to
 *   the next location+offset. Use [textJustify] = [TextJustify.Auto] to choose justification based
 *   on anchor position.
 *
 *   Each anchor location is accompanied by a point which defines the offset when the corresponding
 *   anchor location is used. Positive offset values indicate right and down, while negative values
 *   indicate left and up. Anchor locations may repeat, allowing the renderer to try multiple
 *   offsets to try and place a label using the same anchor.
 *
 *   When present, this property takes precedence over [textAnchor], [textVariableAnchor],
 *   [textOffset] and [textRadialOffset].
 *
 *   Example: ``` listOf( SymbolAnchor.Top to Point(0, 4), SymbolAnchor.Left to Point(3, 0),
 *   SymbolAnchor.Bottom to Point(1, 1) ``` When the renderer chooses the top anchor, [0, 4] will be
 *   used for [textOffset]; the text will be shifted down by 4 ems. When the renderer chooses the
 *   left anchor, [3, 0] will be used for [textOffset]; the text will be shifted right by 3 ems.
 *   Etc.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textPadding Size of the additional area in dp around the text bounding box used for
 *   detecting symbol collisions.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textAllowOverlap If true, the text will be visible even if it collides with other
 *   previously drawn symbols.
 *
 *   Overridden by [textOverlap].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textOverlap Controls whether to show an icon/text when it overlaps other symbols on the
 *   map. See [SymbolOverlap]. Overrides [textAllowOverlap].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 *   **Note**: This property is not supported on native platforms, yet.
 *
 * @param textIgnorePlacement If true, other symbols can be visible even if they collide with the
 *   text.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textOptional If true, icons will display without their corresponding text when the text
 *   collides with other symbols and the icon does not.
 *
 *   Ignored if not both [textField] and [iconImage] are specified.
 *
 * @param textTranslate Distance that the text's anchor is moved from its original placement in dp.
 *   Positive values indicate right and down, while negative values indicate left and up.
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
 *
 * @param textTranslateAnchor Controls the frame of reference for [textTranslate]. See
 *   [TranslateAnchor].
 *
 *   Ignored if [textField] is not specified.
